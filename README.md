## Overview
This is a tutorial project written for S2Hub to showcase how we can work with SilverStripe. 
The article is divided into 4 chapters, with each chapter having a corresponding git-tag to allow you to follow along.
If you want to pick up from a specific chapter, the best is to check out the previous chapter's tag as it covers all the code that 
has been written through out that chapter. So if you want to pick up from chapter 3, you should check out the tag `ch2`:

```bash
git checkout tags/ch2 -b ch2
```
